1. class and object (examples)
2. class has data/attributes and func / methods
3. why python is called object oriented programming?
* everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
 > You can create your own data type
 > code resuability
 > debugging
 > easy to colab

5. End to end project (chatbook class)
 > functions vs method
 > magic method or dunder method
 > self
 > You can create attributes outside class 

 > encapsulation
 > getter and setter
 > static method
 > inheritance 


6. inheritance
 > inheritance code examples
 > why inheritance is needed? (code resuability, parent has no access to child class)
 > what gets inherited - constructor non private attributes, Non private method
 > constructor overloading & method overloading
 > Super keyword (can be used inside the class, cannot access variable/attributes, used only inside child class)
 > Types of inheritance
  1. Single inheritance
  2. Mulitlevel
  3. Hierarchical
  4. multiple <diamond Problem> 
  5. Hybrid
