3. why python is called object oriented programming?
* everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
 > You can create your own data type
 > code resuability
 > debugging
 > easy to colab

 > magic method or dunder method
 > self
 > You can create attributes outside class 

 > encapsulation
 > getter and setter
 > static method
 > inheritance
